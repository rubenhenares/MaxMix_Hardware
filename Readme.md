## Overview
**Maxmix** is an open-source volume mixer that allows you to control the volume applications from an external custom controller.  
It was originally designed to allow to quickly adjust the volume of a game and an external voice chat application like Discord quckly, but it can do so much more...  
You can find out more about the system in the [project website](https://www.maxmixproject.com).

This repository contains the designs to build the official hardware.
